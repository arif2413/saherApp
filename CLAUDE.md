# Wolfram Language Multi-Modal LLM App

## Project Description

This system is a multi-modal assistant built entirely in Wolfram Language, designed as a web application on Wolfram Cloud. It ingests various input types – video, audio, images, user interactions (keyboard/mouse), and web pages – and processes them into text for consumption by a network of Large Language Models (LLMs). The design uses Wolfram Language 14.3 features (notably the new LLMGraph functionality) to orchestrate a hierarchy of LLMs (one Master and multiple Slave LLMs) for intelligent response generation.

### Key Components

#### Input Modules
Handle capturing and importing of video, audio, image, UI events, and webpage data.

#### Processing Pipeline
Transforms each input modality into standardized text (e.g. speech-to-text, image OCR or labels, webpage text scraping).

#### LLM Orchestration (Master/Slave)
A hierarchical LLM system where a Master LLM coordinates one or more specialized Slave LLMs.

#### Tools & Memory
Each LLM (Master or Slave) has access to computational tools (Wolfram functions), context memory (conversation history), and retrieval-augmented knowledge sources as needed.

#### Orchestration Engine
Uses LLMGraph to define the information flow between LLMs and to manage parallelism, conditional logic, and integration of non-LLM functions.

#### Scalability & Modularity
The architecture supports plugging in any number of Slave LLMs without altering the core logic, thanks to the graph-based design.

#### Real-Time Interaction
The system processes inputs and generates responses interactively in real time, leveraging asynchronous evaluation and concurrency to minimize latency.

### Input Acquisition and Processing

#### 1. Video Inputs
Videos are ingested and processed to extract both spoken content and visual information. Wolfram Language provides built-in video processing; for example, VideoTranscribe can perform speech-to-text on a video's audio track, automatically generating a transcript or subtitles. This yields the dialogue or narration as text.

For visual content, frames of the video can be analyzed: functions like ImageIdentify can classify objects or scenes in each frame (e.g. identifying objects present over time), and TextRecognize can detect and read any text appearing in video frames (OCR). All these extracted pieces (spoken words, on-screen text, recognized objects) are converted into a textual description of the video's content.

#### 2. Audio Inputs
Audio (e.g. microphone input or sound files) is processed via speech recognition. Using SpeechRecognize, spoken words in an audio clip are transcribed into text for analysis. By default, SpeechRecognize uses built-in neural networks for English and many other languages, with options to use external services if needed. The result is a text transcript of the audio content.

#### 3. Image Inputs
Stills or images are analyzed to extract meaningful information in text form. If the image contains written content (screenshots, documents, etc.), TextRecognize is used to perform OCR, yielding any detected text as a string. For images without text (photographs, scenes), ImageIdentify attempts to identify the subject matter, returning a probable label or description of what the image depicts.

#### 4. Keyboard & Mouse Events
The web frontend captures user interaction events (clicks, key presses) and passes them into the Wolfram Language backend. Using interface constructs like EventHandler, the app can listen for standard mouse and keyboard events (e.g. "MouseClicked", "KeyDown" events). These events are translated into a text or symbolic form (for example, "User clicked Submit button" or "User pressed Ctrl+C") which the LLM system can interpret.

#### 5. Webpage Inputs
For retrieving and parsing web content (analogous to Puppeteer functionality but within Wolfram), the system uses Wolfram Language's web import capabilities. Import can fetch a webpage's HTML and extract its text content directly. For example, using Import["http://example.com", "Plaintext"] or "Data" yields the textual contents of a page as a string.

### Hierarchical LLM System Design

#### Master–Slave LLM Architecture

**Master LLM**: A central language model agent that interfaces with the user. The Master LLM receives the aggregated text inputs from all sources (video, audio, images, etc.) and is responsible for producing the final response or action. Critically, the Master can also determine when specialized processing or subtasks are needed.

**Slave LLMs**: A collection of one or more specialized language models or prompt workflows, each expert in a certain domain or task. Slaves act as subordinate agents that the Master can call upon for help. For example, one Slave LLM might be specialized in summarizing long texts, another in extracting specific data, another in translating language, etc.

#### LLMGraph Orchestration
We leverage Wolfram Language 14.3's LLMGraph to formally define and execute the interactions between the Master and Slave LLMs. LLMGraph allows us to create a symbolic workflow graph where each node represents a computation by either an LLM or a standard function, and edges represent the flow of data between these nodes.

Key aspects:
- **Parallel and Conditional Execution**: Multiple LLM calls can be scheduled concurrently if they are independent
- **Integration of Tools**: Each node can either invoke an LLM or run an arbitrary Wolfram Language Function
- **Asynchronous Execution**: LLMGraphSubmit for non-blocking evaluation with progress monitoring

#### LLM Capabilities: Tools, Memory, and RAG

**Wolfram Tools Access**: LLMs can use Wolfram's computational engine as a tool for calculations, data analysis, or accessing Wolfram's knowledge base.

**History and Memory**: The system maintains a history of interactions to provide context to the LLMs. The Master LLM's prompt is constructed with a summary or the full text of recent dialogue.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: When dealing with queries that require outside knowledge or large reference texts, the architecture can incorporate RAG techniques using vector databases and nearest neighbor search.

### Deployment as a Wolfram Cloud Web App

**Platform**: Web application on Wolfram Cloud using CloudDeploy with FormFunction or custom WEB Notebook including interactive elements.

**Real-Time Interaction**: Asynchronous operations and dynamic updating using LLMGraphSubmit, TaskObject and ScheduledTask for status polling.

**Security and Permissions**: User data stays within Wolfram Cloud environment with proper permissions and server-side API calls.
