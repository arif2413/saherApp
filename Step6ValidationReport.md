- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network failures, invalid URLs, and parsing errors
- **Multi-Modal Compatibility**: Webpage processing works alongside text, image, audio, and video processing

## Testing Results

All 8 Step 6 tests passed successfully:

1. âœ… **URL Validation**: Successfully validates HTTP/HTTPS URLs and rejects malformed URLs
2. âœ… **Webpage Content Fetching**: Framework function working with timeout protection (network failures handled gracefully)
3. âœ… **HTML Content Parsing**: Successfully parses HTML, extracts titles and text content
4. âœ… **Comprehensive Webpage Processing**: Integration of all webpage processing components
5. âœ… **Webpage-LLM Integration**: Web content properly integrated into LLM prompts
6. âœ… **Webpage Display Formatting**: Web interface displays webpage processing results correctly
7. âœ… **Empty URL Handling**: Proper handling of empty/None URL inputs
8. âœ… **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for invalid URLs and network failures

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each web processing function is self-contained with clear interfaces
- **Network Resilient**: Timeout protection and comprehensive error handling for network issues
- **HTML Processing**: Clean text extraction with removal of scripts, styles, and HTML tags

### Performance Considerations
- **Timeout Protection**: 10-second timeout prevents hanging on unresponsive websites
- **Efficient Parsing**: Simple regex-based HTML parsing for fast text extraction
- **Memory Management**: Proper handling of webpage content without excessive memory usage

## Integration with Existing System

### Multi-Modal Pipeline
Web content processing seamlessly integrates with the existing multi-modal pipeline:
- Text processing âœ…
- Image processing with OCR & object recognition âœ…  
- Audio processing with speech-to-text âœ…
- Video processing with transcription & frame analysis âœ…
- **Web content processing with scraping & parsing** âœ…

### LLM Integration
- Webpage content descriptions are automatically included in LLM prompts
- Combined with other modal inputs for comprehensive AI analysis
- Maintains conversation context across all input types

## User Interface Enhancements

### Web Interface Updates
- Webpage URL input field accepts HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- Processing status displayed during webpage analysis
- Detailed results showing:
  - Webpage title and content preview
  - Word count information
  - Processing status (success/failure)

### Status Updates
- Application status updated to "Step 6 Complete"
- Next step indicator points to keyboard/mouse event processing
- Progress tracking maintained across all implementation steps

## Network Handling

The implementation provides robust network handling:

### Connection Management
- **Timeout Protection**: 10-second timeout prevents hanging requests
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network failures and DNS resolution issues
- **Status Reporting**: Clear error messages for different failure modes

### Security Considerations
- **URL Validation**: Only HTTP/HTTPS URLs accepted
- **Content Filtering**: Script and style tags removed from extracted content
- **Safe Parsing**: Regex-based parsing avoids potential security issues with full HTML parsers

## Framework Readiness

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

### Ready for Advanced Features
- **Advanced Scraping**: Framework ready for more sophisticated web scraping libraries
- **Content Analysis**: Structure supports advanced content analysis and extraction
- **API Integration**: Framework supports integration with web APIs and services

### Scalability
- Functions designed to handle various webpage types and sizes
- Error handling supports different network conditions and failure modes
- Modular architecture allows independent enhancement of each component
