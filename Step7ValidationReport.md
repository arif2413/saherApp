- Progress tracking maintained across all implementation steps

## Event Processing Examples

The implementation handles various event description formats:

### Keyboard Events
- "User pressed Ctrl+C to copy text, then typed 'Hello World' and pressed Enter"
- "Hit F5 to refresh and pressed Alt+Tab to switch windows"
- "Pressed Ctrl+A to select all, then Ctrl+V to paste"

### Mouse Events
- "User clicked on the submit button, then double-clicked on a text field"
- "Moved mouse to (100, 200) and right-clicked to open context menu"
- "Scrolled down to view more content"

### Mixed Events
- "User clicked on input field, typed 'test message', pressed Ctrl+A to select all, then clicked save button"

## Framework Readiness

The implementation provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

### Ready for Advanced Features
- **Real-time Event Capture**: Framework ready for actual keyboard/mouse event capture
- **Event Recording**: Structure supports event logging and playback
- **Automation Integration**: Framework supports integration with automation tools

### Scalability
